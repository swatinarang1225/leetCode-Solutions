## PROBLEM STATEMENT (338. Counting Bits)
### Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

TASK:

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 105

Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of O(n log n). Can you do it in linear time O(n) and possibly in a single pass?
Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like __builtin_popcount in C++)?
